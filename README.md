Ensemble is the platform that powers the Firefox Public Data Report, a weekly
public report on the activity, behavior, and hardware configuration of Firefox
Desktop users.

Ensemble fetches data from
[ensemble-transposer](https://github.com/mozilla/ensemble-transposer), a JSON
server that adds metadata to the raw data hosted by Mozilla data engineers.

Ensemble is written in React with the help of the wonderful
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) tool from
Facebook.
